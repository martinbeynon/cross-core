The mini-distribution "core" buildfile collection
-------------------------------------------------

These buildfiles constitute what is considered the core system - the minimum set of buildfiles required to boot a basic featured system.

Buildfiles in this repository may not depend on buildfiles outside of core.

All buildfiles in this repository are maintained on a regular basis.
